<b>Instead of large font sizes designers tend to use colors.</b> The weight of the tags isn’t only determined by the font-size, but also by the color it has. The more contrast exists between the color of the tag and the background, the more active the tag is. <q>Passive</q> tags usually have colors more similar to the background color — <i>they have to remain in the background.</i>
